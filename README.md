## Instructor: [Annapurna Agrawal][instructor url]

Do you want to get started using one of the hottest new programming languages out there? Then you're in the right place. If you're new to programming, Kotlin is a great language to start with. And if you have a background in another programming language, you'll be able to appreciate just how cool Kotlin is. Kotlin is way more concise, secure and tool-friendly than traditional languages like Java. 
 
In this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to get started coding in the Kotlin language. You'll start from scratch, with a brief overview of Kotlin and its advantages, and a look at how to set up the IDE. Then you'll move on to writing your first Kotlin code and dig deeper into its method of execution. You'll learn the basic syntax before moving on to fundamental topics such as functions and classes, loops and iterators. You'll also get a sneak peek at some advanced features of Kotlin like lambdas, higher order functions and using Java and Kotlin together in the same app.

Kotlin is now an official language for coding Android apps, so let's get started. Happy coding!
